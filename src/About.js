        <h1>What is Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Pulse is a website for students to practice math facts.</p>
        <h1>Why is learning math facts important?</h1>
        <p>Humans can only think about a few things at a time without cognitive overload. 
          Knowing math facts without having to think frees up thinking for more complex math.
        </p>
        <h1>What makes Pulse different from other math fact practice websites?</h1>
        <p1>The best way to respond when a student doesn't know a math fact is to give them 
          more practice with that fact and related facts. 
          Pulse gives students a short chunk of practice each day. 
          First, it figures out what fact families students could use help with, 
          either because they got a question wrong or answered slowly, 
          then gives them focused practice on that fact family.
        </p1>
        <h1>Walk me through what using Pulse is like.</h1>
        <p>Students will click "Ready?" when they are ready to go. 
          They will see a series of problems from different fact families.
          If they get every question right they will progress to the next operation. 
          When the student either gets a question wrong or takes a long time to answer, they will get 30 questions of focused practice on that fact family.
          Questions alternate between the target fact family and previous fact families, and problems they struggle with will repeat.
        </p>
        <h1>Do you guarantee that every student will master their math facts with Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Nope. There are no shortcuts to fact fluency. 
          Pulse can be a helpful tool, especially with students who feel overwhelmed by other forms of fact practice.
          But there are never any guarantees, and Pulse only works as one part of classroom instruction.
        </p>
        <h1>Sometimes students end up working on facts they already know, what's up with that?</h1>
        <p>That will happen. Pulse is probabibilistic. Students will 
          often spend their time on a fact family they aren't as good at, but they might just have
          been chatting with a friend as they got started. That's fine. For addition they'll practice at least
           +1s, +2s, and doubles. For multiplication they'll practice at least 2s, 5s, 10s, and 1s. Those are 
           each a decent chunk of the math facts, and it's good practice even if it's not perfectly targeted that day.
        </p>
        <h1>Who are you?</h1>
        <p>My name is Dylan Kane. I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Colorado. You can get in touch at dkane47 at gmail</p>
        <h1>How do you use Pulse with your students?</h1>
        <p>I assign either Pulse Addition or Pulse Multiplication twice a week. I do some progress monitoring using paper and pencil to 
          figure out which students should be focusing on addition and which on multiplication and use Google Classroom 
          to assign the right link to students. I do a fair amount of coaching, both when we first start Pulse and as I 
          observe students working, to help them understand how to use Pulse to improve their recall of math facts. 
        </p>
        <h1>What should I do to help my students use Pulse effectively?</h1>
        <p>Help them understand that they should try to answer as fast as they can, but if they can't remember a fact that's fine. 
          They'll get some focused practice on that fact. Also, help students understand that if they get facts in their 
          target fact family wrong or answer slowly, that fact will repeat two problems later. That's a great chance to practice remembering it!
        </p>
        <h1>What should I do to help students who don't make progress?</h1>
        <p>Teach them! Pulse is a good tool for practice once students understand how the operations work. 
          If students aren't making progress, help them see patterns in the fact families they are most often working on. 
        </p>
        <h1>Why not have students sign in and track their progress?</h1>
        <p>I prefer a tool that is simple to use. I can see what students are working on by looking at their screen. 
          I also don't like the tools that claim students have "mastered" a skill and then move on. 
          That's not how learning works, students can always benefit from more practice even on facts they mostly know.
        </p>
        <h1>Why not make it a game?</h1>
        <p>Practice is practice. I don't think it's helpful to pretend that practice is a game. 
          Practice is worth doing, and we should be honest with students about that.
        </p>
        <h1>Is there research that supports Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Pulse is informed by lots of research on retrieval practice and interleaving. 
          Research doesn't know the best way to teach multiplication facts, and leaves teachers with more questions than answers. 
          Pulse is designed using a mix of research and classroom experience. 
        </p>
        <h1>Why not use visuals to show how multiplication works?</h1>
        <p>Visuals are a great tool to help students understand how operations work when they're initiall introduced. 
          That's not what Pulse is designed for. Pulse is designed for students who have been introduced to arithemtic operations, 
          but need more practice to commit those facts to memory. For students in that situation, visuals can be an obstacle 
          because they let the student solve by thinking about the visual, rather than retrieving the fact from memory.
