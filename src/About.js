        <h2>What is Pulse?</h2>
        <p>Cognitive science tells us that the best way to secure something in long-term memory is <b>retrieval practice</b>. 
          Retrieval practice means retrieving the thing from memory, not just deriving it or repeating it to ourselves. 
          Pulse is designed to help students retrieve facts from memory. First, it figures out a fact family students are having a hard time with. 
          Then, students do some practice focused on that fact family. 
          For any fact in the fact family they don't know, students practice that fact again a few questions later. 
          If students can't remember a fact or need to skip-count or use their fingers to figure out math facts, Pulse is a good tool to help students commit those facts to long-term memory. 
        </p>

        <h2>How does Pulse figure out if a student knows a fact, rather than finding it by skip-counting or another strategy?</h2>
        <p>Pulse identifies fact families to focus on when a student either gets a question wrong or takes too long to answer. 
          Speed is a decent proxy for having facts in long-term memory. If a student needs five seconds to remember a fact they could benefit from more retrieval practice. 
          Too many apps approach this by pressuring students to solve problems quickly, but telling someone to go faster doesn't necessarily help them commit facts to memory. 
          Instead, Pulse uses speed as an indicator of which facts students can use more practice with. No pressure, but lots of chances for retrieval practice with facts students don't know very well yet. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why is learning math facts important?</h2>
        <p>Humans can only think about a few things at a time. 
          Knowing math facts without having to think about them frees up thinking for more complex math.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Shouldn't students learn math facts with understanding? This seems like rote memorization.</h2>
        <p>Students definitely need to understand how the operations work. Pulse isn't designed to <i>teach</i> facts, it's designed to <i>practice</i> facts. 
        Once students undertand how the different operations work they still have a few hundred specifics facts to remember. 
        That's a lot! You should absolutely teach your students to understand the operations. 
        If your experience is like mine, even after students understand the operations they need more practice to commit them to long-term memory. That's what Pulse is designed for.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>So I can put my students on the app and they'll learn their math facts?</h2>
        <p>I recommend coaching students on how to use the app. They should understand the goal is to remember 
          math facts without having to think about them. I also recommend paying attention to patterns in 
          fact families that students are having a hard time with and providing extra support with those.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Do you guarantee that every student will master their math facts with Pulse?</h2>
        <p>Nope. There are no shortcuts to fact fluency. 
          Pulse can be a helpful tool, especially with students who feel overwhelmed by other forms of fact practice.
          But there are never any guarantees, and Pulse only works as one component of well-designed classroom instruction. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Sometimes students end up working on facts they already know, what's up with that?</h2>
        <p>That will happen. Pulse is probabibilistic. Students will 
          often spend their time on a fact family they aren't as good at, but they might just have
          been chatting with a friend as they got started or made a silly mistake and Pulse thought they needed to practice that fact family. That's fine. 
          They will practice that fact family mixed with a few others, and it's still good practice even if it's not perfectly targeted that day.
        </p>

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>My name is Dylan Kane. I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Colorado. You can get in touch at dkane47 at gmail</p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>How do you use Pulse with your students?</h2>
        <p>I assign either Pulse Addition or Pulse Multiplication twice a week. I do some progress monitoring using paper and pencil to 
          figure out which students should be focusing on addition and which on multiplication and use Google Classroom 
          to assign the right link to students. I do a fair amount of coaching, both when we first start Pulse and as I 
          observe students working, to help them understand how to use Pulse to improve their recall of math facts. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>What should I do to help my students use Pulse effectively?</h2>
        <p>Help them understand that they should try to answer as fast as they can, but if they can't remember a fact that's fine. 
          They'll get some focused practice on that fact and similar facts. Also, help students understand that, if they get facts in their 
          target fact family wrong or answer slowly, that fact will repeat two problems later. That's a great chance to practice remembering it!
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>What should I do to help students who don't make progress?</h2>
        <p>Teach them! Pulse is a good tool for practice once students understand how the operations work. 
          Pulse is not a substitute for teaching about the operations. 
          If students aren't making progress, help them see patterns in the fact families they are often working on. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why not have students sign in and track their progress?</h2>
        <p>I prefer a tool that is simple to use. I can see what students are working on by walking around and looking at their screen. 
          Students don't make nice linear progress in their fact knowledge. 
          I don't think tracking their progress on type of practice is very helpful.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why not make it a game?</h2>
        <p>Practice is important. I don't think it's helpful to pretend that practice is a game. 
          Practice is necessary for learning, and we should be honest with students about that.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Is there research that supports Pulse?</h2>
        <p>Pulse is informed by lots of research on retrieval practice. 
          Research hasn't found the perfect way to teach multiplication facts, so reasonable people might disagree about the best way to structure fact practice based on research. 
          Pulse is designed using a mix of research and classroom experience. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why not use visuals to show how multiplication works?</h2>
        <p>Visuals are a great tool to help students understand how operations work when they're initially introduced. 
          That's not what Pulse is designed for. Pulse is designed for students who have been introduced to arithemtic operations 
          and need more practice to commit those facts to memory. For students in that situation, visuals can be an obstacle 
          because they encourage students to solve by thinking about the visual rather than retrieving the fact from memory.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Can you give a more detailed description of how Pulse works?</h2>
        <p>Sure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the link to addition or multiplication practice, or give students a direct link to the practice page.</li>
          <li>Click "Ready?" when you're ready to go. The goal is to solve the problems quickly, so make sure students are ready!</li>
          <li>Students will see a sequence of 45 problems.</li>
          <li>They will start in analyzing mode. Analyzing mode gives students one question each from a series of fact families. 
            Families for multiplication are 2s, 10s, 5s, 1s, 0s, 11s, 4s, 3s, 6s, 9s, 8s, and 7s. 
            Families for addition are +1s, +2s, doubles, near doubles (i.e. 5+6 or 7+8) +0s, 3s and 4s, and 5s through 8s.</li>
          <li>If students finish all the fact families they "level up," for instance from multiplication to division, then "fill-in-the-blank" multiplication, then "fill-in-the-blank" division.</li>
          <li>Students have 3.5 seconds to answer each question for the first operation, though there's no visible timer on the screen. This time decreases slowly as they move through more operations</li>
          <li>If students get a question wrong or answer slowly they switch to practice mode for that problem.</li>
          <li>In practice mode, half the questions are on that fact family, and the other half are a mix of questions from fact families they've seen.</li>
          <li>If students make a mistake in the first fact family they will see practice from a mix of the first few fact families.</li>
          <li>In practice mode, if students make a mistake or answer slowly on the fact family they are working on they will see that problem again two questions later.</li>
          <li>Problems are random, but students will typically see problems from that fact family multiple times each in a pracice session to encourage retrieval practice.</li>
          <li>After 45 problems, students will see a message saying "Nice! You're done for today." That's it!</li>
