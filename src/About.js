        <h1>What makes Pulse different from other math fact practice websites?</h1>
        <p1>Answer</p1>
        <h1>Walk me through what using Pulse is like.</h1>
        <p>I assign students to either Pulse Addition or Pulse Multiplication by linking directly</p>
        <h1>Do you guarantee that every student will master their math facts with Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Nope. There are lots of math fact practice tools on the internet.
          I think Pulse is a useful tool but there is no shortcut
        </p>
        <h1>Sometimes students end up working on facts they already know, what's up with that?</h1>
        <p>That will happen. Pulse is fundamentally probabibilistic. Students will 
          often spend their time on a fact family they aren't as good at, but they might just have
          been chatting with a friend as they got started. That's fine. For addition they'll practice
           +1s, +2s, and doubles. For multiplication they'll practice 2s, 5s, 10s, and 1s. Those are 
           each a decent chunk of the math facts, and it's good practice even if it's not perfectly targeted that day.

        <h1>Who are you?</h1>
        <p>My name is Dylan Kane. I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Colorado. You can get in touch at dkane47@gmail.com</p>
        <h1>How do you use Pulse with your students?</h1>
        <p>I assign either Pulse Addition or Pulse Multiplication twice a week. I do some progress monitoring to 
          figure out which students should be focusing on addition and which on multiplication and use Google Classroom 
          to assign the right link to students. I do a fair amount of coaching, both when we first start Pulse and as I 
          observe students working, to help them understand how to use it to improve their memory of math facts.
