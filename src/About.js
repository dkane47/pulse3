        <h2>What makes Pulse different from other math practice apps?</h2>
        <p>
          Pulse gives students a short, focused, and manageable chunk of practice to help them make steady progress toward fact fluency. 
          The app balances repetition with facts in a single fact family and a mix of more familiar practice in each session. 
          Students can make progress with one fact family without being overwhelmed by too many new facts at once. 
          <br></br><br></br>Pulse doesn't use visuals or other representations of arithmetic. 
          Visuals play an important role when students are first learning about arithmetic, but they can lead to inefficient strategies while students should be committing facts to long-term memory. 
          <br></br><br></br>Pulse also doesn't put time pressure on students. Instead, the app uses speed as a way to figure out which facts students need more practice with. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why is repetition of a single fact family imortant?</h2>
        <p>Cognitive science tells us that the best way to secure something in long-term memory is <b>retrieval practice</b>. 
          Retrieval practice means retrieving the thing from memory, not using a strategy or being told the answer. 
          Pulse is designed to help students retrieve facts from memory. First, the app figures out a fact family students are having a hard time with. 
          Then, students do some practice focused on that fact family. 
          Some focused repetition on one fact family helps students to practice retrieving those facts successfully. 
          The target fact family is mixed with facts they answered correctly to avoid overwhelming students. 
          For any fact in the target fact family they don't know, students practice that fact again two questions later. 
          If students have trouble remembering facts or need to skip-count or use their fingers to figure out math facts, Pulse is a good tool to help them commit those facts to long-term memory. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>How does Pulse figure out if a student knows a fact?</h2>
        <p>Pulse identifies fact families to focus on when a student either gets a question wrong or takes too long to answer. 
          Speed is a decent proxy for having facts in long-term memory. If a student needs five seconds to remember a fact they could benefit from more retrieval practice. 
          Pulse doesn't pressure students to solve problems quickly. Telling someone to go faster doesn't necessarily help them commit facts to memory. 
          Instead, Pulse uses speed as an indicator of which facts students could use more practice with. No pressure, but lots of chances for retrieval practice with facts students don't know very well yet. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why is learning math facts important?</h2>
        <p>Humans can only think about a few things at a time. 
          Knowing math facts without having to think about them frees up thinking for more complex math.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Shouldn't students learn math facts with understanding? This seems like rote memorization.</h2>
        <p>Students definitely need to understand arithmetic. That's what teachers are for. Pulse isn't designed to <i>teach</i> facts, it's designed to <i>practice</i> facts. 
        Once students undertand the basics of arithmetic they still have a few hundred specifics facts to remember. 
        That's a lot! You should absolutely teach your students to understand the properties of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
        If your experience is like mine, even after students understand the operations they need more practice to commit facts to long-term memory. That's what Pulse is designed for.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Is there research that supports Pulse?</h2>
        <p>Pulse is informed by research on retrieval practice, incremental rehearsal, and interleaving. 
          Research hasn't found the perfect way to teach multiplication facts. Reasonable people disagree about the best way to structure fact practice based on research. 
          Pulse is also informed by classroom testing to be practical and easy to use while also using insights from research. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Do you guarantee that every student will master their math facts with Pulse?</h2>
        <p>Nope. There are no shortcuts to fact fluency. 
          Pulse can be a helpful tool, especially with students who feel overwhelmed by other forms of fact practice.
          But there are never any guarantees, and Pulse only works as one component of well-designed classroom instruction. 
          I recommend coaching students on how to use the app for best results. 
          Students should understand that the goal is to remember math facts without having to derive them.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Sometimes students end up working on facts they already know, what's up with that?</h2>
        <p>That will happen. Pulse is probabibilistic. Students will 
          often spend their time on a fact family they need practice with, but they might just have
          been chatting with a friend as they got started or made a silly mistake and Pulse thought they needed to practice that fact family. That's fine. 
          They will practice that fact family mixed with a few others, and it's still good practice even if it's not perfectly targeted that day. 
          The order of the fact families is random, so students will see all facts over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>My name is Dylan Kane. I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Colorado. You can get in touch at dkane47 at gmail</p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>How do you use Pulse with your students?</h2>
        <p>I assign Pulse twice a week. Students do it in class before another activity on their Chromebooks. I do some progress monitoring using paper and pencil to 
          figure out which operations we should focus on. I do a fair amount of coaching, both when we first start Pulse and as I 
          observe students working, to help them understand how to improve their recall of math facts. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>What should I do to help my students use Pulse effectively?</h2>
        <p>Help them understand that they should try to answer as fast as they can, but if they can't remember a fact that's fine. 
          They'll get some focused practice on that fact and similar facts. Also, help students understand that, if they get facts in their 
          target fact family wrong or answer slowly, that fact will repeat two problems later. That's a great chance to practice remembering it! 
          Make sure students aren't just hitting enter and copying answers every time. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>What should I do to help students who don't make progress?</h2>
        <p>Teach them! Pulse is a good tool for practice once students have a decent foundation. 
          Pulse is not a substitute for teaching. 
          If students aren't making progress, help them see patterns in the fact families they are often working on. 
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why not have students sign in and track their progress?</h2>
        <p>I prefer a tool that is simple to use. I can see what students are working on by walking around and looking at their screens. 
          Students don't always make nice linear progress in their fact knowledge. 
          I don't find that tracking progress on this type of practice is very helpful.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Why not make it a game?</h2>
        <p>Practice is important. I don't think it's helpful to pretend that practice is a game. 
          Practice is necessary for learning, and we should be honest with students about that. 
          Pulse is short, tyically 2-4 minutes per day, and I have no issue asking students to do a bit of practice to sharpen their math skills.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Can you give a more detailed description of how Pulse works?</h2>
        <p>Sure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the link to addition or multiplication practice, or give students a direct link to the practice page 
            (<a href="/add">pulsemath.com/add</a> or <a href="/multiply">pulsemath.com/multiply</a>).</li>
          <li>Students will click "Ready?" when they're ready to go. The goal is to solve the problems quickly, so make sure students are ready!</li>
          <li>Students will see a problem and a countdown telling them they have 45 problems left.</li>
          <li>They will start in analyzing mode. Analyzing mode gives students one question each from a series of fact families. 
            The order of the fact families is different every time, but always begins with addition or multiplication.</li>
          <li>If students get four questions right in a row they "level up" to the next operation, for instance from multiplication to division, then "fill-in-the-blank" multiplication, then "fill-in-the-blank" division.</li>
          <li>Students have 3.5 seconds to answer each question for the first operation, though there's no visible timer on the screen. This time decreases slowly as they move through more operations</li>
          <li>If students get a question wrong or answer slowly they switch to practice mode for that fact family.</li>
          <li>In practice mode, half the questions are on that fact family and the other half are a mix of questions from fact families they've seen.</li>
          <li>If students make a mistake on the first fact family they will see practice from a few fact families they are likely to know. These are x0, x1, x2, and x10 for multiplication and +0, +1, and +2 for addition. </li>
          <li>In practice mode, if students make a mistake or answer slowly on the fact family they are working on they will see that problem again two questions later.</li>
          <li>Problems are random, but students will typically see each problem from that fact family multiple times each in a pracice session to encourage successful retrieval practice.</li>
          <li>After 45 problems, students will see a message saying "Nice! You're done for today." That's it!</li>
        </ul>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>What are the fact families that Pulse uses?</h2>
        <p>For addition, the fact families are +0, +1, +2, doubles, near doubles (i.e. 4+5, 6+7), +3s and 4s, and +5s through +8s. 
          Those later fact families seem bigger but most facts with 5s through 8s fall into one of the other families. 
          For multiplication, the fact families are x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6/7/8, x9, x10, and x11. 
          Same thing -- most 6s, 7s, and 8s are covered by one of the other fact families. 
          If students get through all of those they will work on two digit by two digit addition, or some larger multiplication facts like x12, x25, x15, and more.
