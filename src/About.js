        <h1>What is Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Pulse is a website for students to practice basic math facts.</p>
        <h1>Why is learning math facts important?</h1>
        <p>Answer</p>
        <h1>What makes Pulse different from other math fact practice websites?</h1>
        <p1>Pulse is simple and gives students a short chunk of practice each round. 
          It tries to figure out what fact families students could use help with, 
          either because they got a question wrong or answered slowly, 
          then gives them focused practice on that fact family.
        </p1>
        <h1>Walk me through what using Pulse is like.</h1>
        <p>Students will click "Ready?" when they are ready to go. 
          They will see a series of problems that progress in difficulty. 
          In Pulse Multiplication they will see a x2 fact, then x10, x5, x1, x0, x11, x3, x4, x6, x9, x8, and x7.
          In Pulse multiplication they will see a +1, +2, double (i.e. 6 + 6), near double (i.e. 7+8), a +3 or +4, and then a +5 through +8. 
          If they get every question right they will progress to the next operation - 
          for instance multiplication, fill-in-the-blank multiplication (i.e. 4 x ___ = 20), division, and fill-in-the-blank division. 
          When the student either gets a question wrong or takes a long time to answer, they will get 30 questions of focused practice on that fact family.
          Questions will alternate between the target fact family and previous fact families, and problems they struggle with will repeat.
        </p>
        <h1>Do you guarantee that every student will master their math facts with Pulse?</h1>
        <p>Nope. There are lots of math fact practice tools on the internet.
          I think Pulse is a useful tool but there is no shortcut to fact fluency. 
          Pulse works best if there is a teacher coaching students on how to use it, 
          giving extra support to students who aren't making progress, and 
          noticing areas where the whole class could use support and teaching those topics.
        </p>
        <h1>Sometimes students end up working on facts they already know, what's up with that?</h1>
        <p>That will happen. Pulse is fundamentally probabibilistic. Students will 
          often spend their time on a fact family they aren't as good at, but they might just have
          been chatting with a friend as they got started. That's fine. For addition they'll practice
           +1s, +2s, and doubles. For multiplication they'll practice 2s, 5s, 10s, and 1s. Those are 
           each a decent chunk of the math facts, and it's good practice even if it's not perfectly targeted that day.

        <p>My name is Dylan Kane. I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Colorado. You can get in touch at dkane47 at gmail</p>
        <h1>How do you use Pulse with your students?</h1>
        <p>I assign either Pulse Addition or Pulse Multiplication twice a week. I do some progress monitoring to 
          figure out which students should be focusing on addition and which on multiplication and use Google Classroom 
          to assign the right link to students. I do a fair amount of coaching, both when we first start Pulse and as I 
          observe students working, to help them understand how to use it to improve their memory of math facts.
