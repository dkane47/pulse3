        <h2>How does the integers practice work?</h2>
        <p>The basic premise is similar to the other pages. Instead of fact families, integers practice focuses on 
          categories of questions like "positive + negative" or "negative times negative" or "positive minus positive." 
          All of the possibilities for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are mixed together randomly, with a bit more emphasis on addition and multiplication. 
          The time to answer a question before going into practice mode is a bit longer than for the other operations. 
          Once a student either makes a mistake or answers a question slowly, they get focused practice on that problem type. 
          Unlike the other pages, each problem type gets a random mix that is unique to that type. 
          For instance, if the student makes a mistake on a "negative times a negative" fact, here's the mix they will see: 
          Most problems will either be negative times negative or positive times positive, to practice the target skill while mixing in easier problems. 
          However, they will also see a few positive times negative, negative plus negative, and positive plus negative problems. 
          These are less frequent, and help to ensure there is still some intereleaved practice and avoid overgeneralizations. 
          Each problem type gets a unique mix of problems designed to focus on that problem type while mixing with some easier questions and a few similar questions that we want students to disambiguate.
