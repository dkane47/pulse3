        <h2>How does the integers practice work?</h2>
        <p>The basic premise is similar to the other pages. Instead of fact families, integers practice focuses on 
          categories of questions like "positive + negative" or "negative times negative" or "positive minus positive." 
          All of the possibilities for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are mixed together randomly to to begin, with a bit more emphasis on addition and multiplication. 
          Once a student either makes a mistake or answers a question slowly, they get focused practice on that problem type. 
          Unlike the other pages, each problem type gets a random mix that is unique to that type. 
          For instance, if the student makes a mistake on a "negative times a negative" fact, here's the mix they will see: 
          Most problems will either be negative times negative or positive times positive, to practice the target skill while mixing in easier problems. 
          However, they will also see a few positive times negative, negative plus negative, and positive plus negative problems. 
          These are less frequent, and help to ensure there is still some intereleaved practice to avoid overgeneralizations. 
          Each problem type gets a unique mix of problems designed to focus on that problem type while mixing with some easier questions and a few other questions that we want students to discriminate between.

        <h2>What do students need to know to be ready to use integers practice?</h2>
        <p>
          Students should have a strong grasp of their addition and subtraction facts, and most multiplication facts. 
          Multiplication avoids larger facts like 6x9, 8x7, etc. They should also have a decent conceptual grasp of integer operations. 
          Pulse is not designed to teach concepts that students don't know; it is designed to practice skills that take time to commit to long-term memory. 
          Even after students understand the basics of integer operations, it takes practice to get fluent in all the different possible problem types. 
          That's what Pulse is designed for. If students don't have that foundation, the practice won't be as effective.
